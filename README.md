These are the mods for the Mogotech modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2

Mogotech is a, more or less, testing bed for a tech heavy modpack that is relatively small compared to other modpacks. I wanted to create a modpack that was lightweight and fast-loading.

Getting your system ready to play on the mogotech server is a multi-step process because the modpack itself is a work-in-progress and files are being added to the server manually as needed to make playability improvements. The first step is to download and install the Mogotech modpack from curseforge.com or via the Twitch app. This will get you most of the way there. After that there are several mods that have been added to the server manually that will have to be downloaded to your client before you can log onto the server. Every mod is currently in the mods folder here on this repository. Simply clone or download it to your system and copy the contents of the mod folder to your Mogotech mods folder. Below is a list of the files not currently included in the Mogotech modpack:

Simple Storage Network,
/dank/null,
Inventory Tweaks,
Ex Compressum,
Morpheus,
Ex Nihilo Creatio,
p455w0rds (/dank/null dependency),
Extra Utilities 2,
Dark Utilities,
Bookshelf.

April 24, 2020 - Removed buildcraft. Added Mekanism, Mekanism Generators, Mekanism Tools.

Honestly, if you're trying to play the Mogotech modpack on my server it means I know you. If you have any issues just reach out to me on the Refugee Gamers discord.
